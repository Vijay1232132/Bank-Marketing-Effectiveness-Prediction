# Bank-Marketing-Effectiveness-Prediction
Data from a marketing campaign run by Portugal banking Institution. The
campaign’s aim was to increase customers’ subscription rates to fixed-term
deposit products, such as CDs. Using knowledge from the course, a number of
machine learning algorithms are implemented to answer the question: How
can banks successfully market these products in the most efficient way
possible and with the highest possible rate of success?
